#Ilume Backend Plugin
Adds some JS to the Backend if the Pages Plugin is active and currently in use. This will happen during the BOOT of the 
plugin.

## Building
We use Typescript. run tsc or tsc --watch in /src to change something. You may create other .ts files in /src, 
these will be compiled as well. The result is stored in /assets/js/ilume-backend.js.
