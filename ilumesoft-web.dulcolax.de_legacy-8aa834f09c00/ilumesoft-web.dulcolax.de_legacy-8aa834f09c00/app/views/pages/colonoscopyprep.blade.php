					<h2>Our goals are simple. More screenings. More survivors.</h2>
					<p>
						Of cancers that affect both men and women, colorectal cancer is the 2nd leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States and the 3rd most common cancer in men and in women. One in 20 people will develop colon cancer, but with early screenings it is highly preventable. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The makers of Dulcolax<sup>&reg;</sup> are proud to partner with the <a href="http://www.ccalliance.org" target="_blank" class="pLink">Colon Cancer Alliance (CCA)</a> to raise awareness about screenings that can help prevent death from colon cancer. The CCA is the leading national patient advocacy organization dedicated to increasing screening rates and survivorship.

						<p>
							Early detection is vital. The American Cancer Society recommends that in order to help prevent colorectal cancer, men and women over the age of 50 should receive a colonoscopy every 10 years. If you are 50 or older, or have a family history of polyps or colon cancer, talk to your doctor about getting screened.
						</p>
						<p>
							When detected and treated early, colon cancer is 90% curable. A screening test, like a colonoscopy, could be a lifesaver. Here's how:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Colon cancer usually starts from polyps in the colon or rectum. A polyp is a growth that shouldn't be there 
							</li>
							<li>
								Some polyps can turn into cancer 
							</li>
							<li>
								Screening tests, like colonoscopies, can find polyps, which can then be removed before they turn into 	cancer 
							</li>
							<li>
								Screening tests can detect colon cancer in its early stages, when treatment is most effective 
							</li>

					<h2>What to expect from a colonoscopy</h2>
					<p>
						Many people are apprehensive about getting a colonoscopy, as they do not know what to expect from this kind of test. Here is some general information regarding the procedure and what you could expect.
					</p>
					<p>
						In advance of the test, you will be given instructions by your health professional outlining what you should and shouldn't do in preparation for the colonoscopy. Be sure to read and follow these instructions exactly, as it is important to have the colon thoroughly cleaned out.
					</p>
					<p>
						<a href="#" class="greenLink hideShow plus" rel="expect">
							<span class="more">Read more about what to expect about from a colonoscopy</span>
							<span class="less">Read less</span>
						</a>	
					</p>
					<div class="expect info-hs">
						<p>
							Every health professional has their own preferred method for cleaning out the colon. Often, a laxative liquid and/ or tablets designed to stimulate the bowel is given. Plan to stay home during the prep time as you will need to use the bathroom often. You can expect loose, frequent stools and diarrhea. For many patients, this is the most trying part of the procedure.
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition, your doctor will put you on a restricted diet 1 to 2 days in advance of the test. During this period, you are typically limited to clear fluids (water, black tea or coffee, clear juices, clear broths). Popsicles or Jell-O are allowed but they cannot contain red or purple dyes. You may also be asked to stop taking certain medicines, like aspirin or iron supplements, 1 to 2 weeks in advance of the test. Please make sure you discuss all your medications with your health professional in order to best advise you.
						</p>
						<p>
							On the day of the procedure, you will need to arrange for someone to drive you to and from the test. Typically an IV is given with a medication to make you relaxed and drowsy, and ensure you are as comfortable as possible during the procedure. An average colonoscopy takes about 30 to 45 minutes. The test could run longer depending upon what is found and done during the test.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can expect to feel drowsy most of the day. Most people feel normal once the effects of the sedative wear off. Some people may have gas pains and cramping for a while after the test.
						</p>
						<p>
							Your health professional may recommend <a href="{{action('PageController@laxatives')}}" class="pLink">Dulcolax<sup>&reg;</sup> Laxative Tablets</a> and <a href="{{action('PageController@DulcolaxSuppository')}}" class="pLink">Suppositories</a> as part of the colonoscopy preparation process.
