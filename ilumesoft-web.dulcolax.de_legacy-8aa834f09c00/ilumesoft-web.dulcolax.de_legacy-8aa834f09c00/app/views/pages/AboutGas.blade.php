      <!--h2>What is Gas?</h2>     
      <p>Gas is air in your digestive tract.  It is made up mostly of carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen and occasionally methane. Unlike burping, gas that is passed through the anus (flatus) may contain sulfur which contributes to unpleasant odors. When people talk about having gas, the symptoms usually include burping, bloating, abdominal pain or discomfort, and passing gas. Having gas can be quite uncomfortable or painful.</p>
      <p>While having some gas is normal, there are certain foods and beverages that can increase your body's gas intake or production.
